# Simon Says Game

Simon Says is a classic memory game where players need to remember and repeat a sequence of colors. This project implements the game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Gameplay

- When the game starts, a random color will flash.
- The player must then click on the corresponding color to repeat the sequence.
- If the player gets the sequence correct, the game moves to the next level with an additional color added to the sequence.
- If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, displaying their final score.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Game Logic

- The game starts when the user presses any key.
- Each level of the game adds a new color to the sequence.
- When the player clicks a color, the corresponding function checks if the sequence matches the player's input.
- If the sequence is correct, the game moves to the next level. If not, the game ends.

- `style.css`: Defines the styles for the game interface.
- `script.js`: Implements the game logic using JavaScript.
